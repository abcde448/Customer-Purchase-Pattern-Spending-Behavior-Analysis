# Customer Purchase Pattern & Spending Behavior Analysis

> This project is **purely focused on Statistical Analysis** — not on model improvement or advanced machine learning optimization.  
> The goal is to demonstrate the complete end-to-end process of data exploration, hypothesis testing, and regression-based insight generation.

## Project Overview
This project explores customer purchase behavior using the Kaggle E-commerce dataset.  
Through data cleaning, statistical testing, and visualization, it uncovers how income, quantity, and discounts influence total spending.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and data types.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Distribution, summary stats, and customer/country patterns.  
3. **Hypothesis Testing** –  
   - Independent t-test (Gender vs Spending)  
   - One-Way ANOVA (Age Group vs Spending)  
   - Chi-square (Discount vs Purchase Frequency)  
4. **Regression Modeling** –  
   - Simple Linear Regression (Income → Spending)  
   - Multiple Regression (Income, Quantity, Discount → Spending)  
5. **Visualization & Storytelling** – Eye-catching Matplotlib + Seaborn visuals with English storytelling.

## Key Insights
- **Quantity** has the strongest positive effect on spending.  
- **Income** and **Discounts** show weak or negative influence.  
- **R² = 0.137**, indicating that basic variables explain ~13.7% of spending variance — realistic for behavioral data.  
- Results suggest that spending is driven by complex, non-linear behavioral factors.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn, SciPy  
- Google Colab

This project focuses on understanding customer behavior through a statistical lens rather than optimizing predictive accuracy.  
By combining hypothesis testing and regression modeling, it highlights how fundamental statistical tools can uncover meaningful insights from business data — bridging the gap between data exploration and business decision-making.
